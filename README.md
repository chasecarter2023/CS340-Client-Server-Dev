How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To ensure programs are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I use a modular design, clean and consistent coding practices. In the CRUD Python module for Project One, I abstracted database operations into reusable functions, making the code easier to debug and adapt for different applications. This approach allowed me to  integrate the CRUD operations with the dashboard in Project Two, streamlining the connection between the widgets and the database. The main advantage of this approach was its reusability—if I need to connect a different dashboard or system to a database in the future, the same module can be leveraged with minimal changes. This modularity significantly reduces development time for similar projects.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A computer scientist breaks problems into smaller manageable parts. For Grazioso Salvare's requirements, I began by understanding the database structure and the dashboard functionality, then identified how the two could interact. Unlike assignments in other courses, this project required balancing backend database logic with frontend user interaction, it made me think about both data manipulation and user experience simultaneously. In the future, I would use prototyping and iterative testing to ensure the database and dashboard meet the client’s needs more effectively. Creating clear documentation and visualizing data workflows would also help align the project deliverables with client expectations.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design, build, and optimize systems to solve real-world problems, often by creating software that processes data efficiently and effectively. In the Grazioso Salvare project, my work demonstrated how data from a shelter's database could be analyzed and visualized to support decision-making. By filtering and presenting animal data tailored to specific rescue scenarios, the dashboard enables the organization to allocate resources more effectively. This not only streamlines operations but also enhances the company's impact in saving lives, showcasing how computer science bridges technical solutions and societal challenges.
